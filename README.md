# Beaufort-benthos

This repository has mothur and R scripts used in the publication 
"Patterns in benthic microbial community structure across environmental 
gradients in the Beaufort Sea shelf and slope".

Demultiplexing (Beaufort-demult) was done using Mr. Demuxy and the script for this is a combination of bash and python script (Mr. Demuxy).

Mothur script (mothur-of-Beaufort) is written within batch jobs submitted to the UAF RCS Chinook super computing cluster which uses the slurm system. So each file created using the nano command is the job file submitted to the system to be run in mothur.
